## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James Yahr, a current Junior Cybersecurity student at Illinois State University. Most of my personal projects focus on red-teaming and penetration testing, whereas more of my professional experience is on the blue-teaming side. I am always looking to expand my skills on both sides and learn anything new that come out along the way, including gaining more real-world word experience in the field. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about me or any of my projects!
